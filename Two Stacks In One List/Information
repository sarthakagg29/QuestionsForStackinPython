In this Code, we have used a single list to support two stacks.
I was implementing stacks using list data structure and this time two stacks in a same list.

Instead of giving particular length of each stack in the list.
I used two tops of two stacks one starting from the position -1 and other from length of stack.

in this The Time Complexity is O(1) and Space Complexity is the size of list no empty spaces.

Here I used a stack class having Different Methods in it which can be accessed by writing and following instructions.

In the TwoStack Class, the length of stack is decided by the combination of height of First Stack and Seocnd Stack.
The Tops are ftop for First Stack from -1 and ltop for Second Stack from length of Stack.

Eveytime an element is pushed into first Stack, ftop will be increased by 1 and element will be pushed into the list.
With Conditions including, If ftop index + 1 is equal is to index of ltop then the Stack will OverFlow.
